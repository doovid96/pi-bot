# Discord Bot

## Dependencies

### [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)

`npm install discord.js`

discord.js is a powerful Node.js  module that allows you to interact with the Discord API  very easily. It takes a much more object-oriented approach than most other JS Discord libraries, making your bot's code significantly tidier and easier to comprehend.

Usability, consistency, and performance are key focuses of discord.js, and it also has nearly 100% coverage of the Discord API. It receives new Discord features shortly after they arrive in the API.

### [googleapis](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs)

`npm install googleapis@39 --save`

With a keyfile (credentials.json) containing an authorized Google Service Account's credentials, send read requests.

### [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

Create `credentials.json` via a Google Service Account with read access on the Google Sheet.

### [dayjs](https://day.js.org/)

Day.js is a minimalist JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and displays dates and times for modern browsers with a largely Moment.js-compatible API.
